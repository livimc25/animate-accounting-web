    <p>The Income Statement is one of the four main financial statements. Its purpose is to display revenues and expenses 
    for a stated period of time. On the Income Statement, revenues, or sales, have a normal credit balance. Expenses have 
    a normal debit balance. The accounts in the Income Statement are all considered to be temporary, and they will be 
    cleared at the end of the year. To discover more about the income statement, click <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp" class="ready-to-begin">here</a>.
